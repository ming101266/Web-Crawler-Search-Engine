Hello!

This is a search engine for UW CSE 123's course website utilizing web crawlers. 
Please feel free to use it to your advantage. 

This project is created using Maven. Please also set up using Maven (it is easier, trust me)
Maven site: https://maven.apache.org/

Then, click on App.java is you prefer terminal based and WebCrawlerGUI.java if you prefer a basic text GUI version
The files should have headers that include what you need to paste into your terminal. 
Ask me either here, in Ed, or in-person for instructions or pull requests.
